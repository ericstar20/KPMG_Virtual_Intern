A big thank you to KPMG for providing this VI based internship!

Really enjoyed my time working on this small project over the summer semester break.\
Fascinating to see how data is transformed into usable information, which is then formed as part of a business plan to drive growth.

I found this virtual internship not only useful in terms of applying my knowledge and skills, but learning about the ongoings inside a management consultancy firm and that there is more to 'consultancy' than accountants counting their jelly beans. 


## Objective
<img src = "sprocket_central_logo.png" width='400' heigh='200'> 

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-size bikes & cycling accessories organization, has approached KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team.\
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team.\
As a data analyst, my primary mission is assisting Sprocket Central Pty Ltd with its customer and transaction data. Then, help them to make better marketing strategies.

## Getting Started
This internships has three Tasks:

1. Data Quality: this task involved assessing the data quality to ensure it was ready for analysis.

2. Data Insights: this module involved analysing customer databases to determine customer trends and behaviour.

3. Data Presentation: dashboards were created to suggest ways on how the client could think about growing the business. 
      
## Result
I used Agglomerative Clustering to create customer segments on the old customer data. Then, using this model to predict new customers' potential clusters. 
Last but not least, I created the interactive dashboard more for the client to understand the result easily.
